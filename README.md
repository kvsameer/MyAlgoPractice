# My Algorithm Practice 🧠

This repository contains my ongoing algorithm and data structure practice — written in Java — with a focus on **clarity, invariants, and architectural reasoning** rather than brute force.

### 📘 Patterns Covered
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Recursion (Tower of Hanoi, Reverse Linked List)
- Dynamic Programming (in progress)
- Greedy and Graph algorithms (coming soon)

### 🧩 Example
**Tower of Hanoi (Recursion + Immutable Modeling)**  
Shows how recursive calls can be designed cleanly using Java records for state modeling.

### 🛠 How to Run
```bash
javac src/Main.java
java Main
